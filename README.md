# Surf Safe

## Overview
"Surf Safe" is an innovative and educational platform designed to enhance online safety by encouraging users to practice safe and responsible internet behaviors. By engaging in interactive simulations and conversational interfaces, participants are exposed to the potential outcomes of their online actions. Our goal is to inform and equip web users with the knowledge and tools they need to navigate the digital world securely and with confidence.
"Surf Safe" emerged from a collaborative effort during the hackathon at the **"BeSafe" event**, a partnership between **QueenB** and **AppsFlyer**. This event was dedicated to making the internet a safer place for everyone. It was here that our team came up with the idea of "Surf Safe" as our contribution to this noble cause.

## Features

 ### Interactive Website Simulations:
  The platform offers interactive simulations that allow users to navigate through various online scenarios without exposing themselves to actual risk. Whether it involves evaluating suspicious links, deciding against sharing credit card information, or refraining from sending personal addresses, users can explore the consequences of their actions in a safe environment.
   ### Chat Interactions:
   Our chat feature is a simulated environment that replicates conversations with strangers, providing users with predetermined response options rather than allowing free text. When a user selects an answer, if the choice involves a potential risk, we promptly inform and educate them about the dangers involved. This interactive experience is designed to teach users the dos and don'ts of communicating with unknown individuals online.
